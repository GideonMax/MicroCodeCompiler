# MicroCodeCompiler
A c++ library for compiling old style micro code<br>
for background info either read "background info.md" or follow the instructions in "language docs.md"<br>
for documentation on the language itself, read "language docs.md"

the solution contains two projects, the library and the compiler.

to use the compiler, just open a .miccode file with it.

using the library:

build

include the header file and make sure the .lib file is accessible to the project.

get a runtime using
```cpp
MicroCodeCompiler::Runtime r= MicroCodeCompiler::Compile(FilePath);
```
be aware that if the filepath uses \\, they will be converted to /, and not on a copy, on the array you have provided

then, to execute the runtime and get the output for a given eeprom, do:
```cpp
uint64_t* a;
size_t length=r.Run(Eeprom,a);
```
Eeprom is an int, signifying which Eeprom you want to evaluate (starts from 0)<br>
to get the Amount of eeproms use `r.EepromCount`.

to run a Runtime for all eeproms and write the output to files use:
```cpp
MicroCodeCompiler::Write(r,FilePath);
```
where r is the runtime and FilePath is the path to the code file,<br>
the output directory will be generated in the same directory as the code file
